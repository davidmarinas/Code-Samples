This code sample features two projects that I have worked on at USC.

Power The Flower: The Power the Flower scripts feature the main scripts used in the game to implement the light reflection mechanic in the game.

Parkour Lab: The Parkour lab code features code from my Video Game Programming class where we coded classic video games in C++. Some of the code in the folder was generated by my instructor, however, most functionality, such as player movement, security cone detection, and laser detection was implemented by me as part of the course. Since I am unable to share my instructor's full build/project, it is not currently runnable at this state.
